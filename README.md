## Summary
There isn't a very significant difference between the 5 star precentages, Vine reviewrs left 51% 5 star reviews and Non-Viners left a an average of 47% 5 star reviews. Now when we look at the total numbers things look about the same, just very different sample sizes, Viners making up only 21 total reveiews left 10 5 stars but with Non-Viners leaving a whopping 6690 reviews and a total of 3448 reviews. I believe we can determine that the skew stays the same between paid and unpaid reviwers, could the money incentivise more 5 stars, yes, but does this disproportionatley effect the reviews? Not really, it stays pretty consistant overall.
